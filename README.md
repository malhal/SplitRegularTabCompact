# SplitRegularTabCompact
This is my attempt to make a SwiftUI app that uses a split view when regular width and a tab view when compact, e.g. when multitasking split on iPad. The aim was to retain the navigation state when switching unlike Apple's Fruta sample.

1. Launch the application on an iPad Simulator.
2. Bring up the dock and drag an app, e.g. Messages, on to the right.
3. Drag the split divider to the left so the app changes in to compact mode.

Notice how if you select Goodbye, in compact the second tab will be selected and in regular the second row will be selected.
